# ReactApp
It's my testing ground for CSS and TypeScript using React.

### Idea
The idea for the app for now is to make an online shop selling tickets for som type of convetion/convention/event. 
The plan is to first develop basic Front-End then Back-End and finish them together adding Back-End endpoints as they are needed.

### Technologies used
* TypeScript
* React
##### To be added
* ASP.NET
* C#
* Microservice Architecture
* RabbitMQ
* Docket Support
* Hosting (Probably on Azure but who knows)
