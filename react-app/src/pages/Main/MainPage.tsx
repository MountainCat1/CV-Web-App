                        I am studying and working in order to gain experience and practical skills. I have no problem
                        listening
                        and learning from the more experienced team members. I understand that there is still a long way to go,
                        on
                        the programmer's path.

                        As a member of the team, I am very cheerful, and I can introduce a looser and more pleasant atmosphere for
                        everyone.
