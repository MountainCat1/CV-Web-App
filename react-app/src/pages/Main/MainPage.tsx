                    I am studying and working in order to gain experience and practical skills. Like every student, I have
                    my
                    shortcomings, but i easly make up for it with my commitment and determination. I have no problem
                    listening
                    and learning from the more experienced team members. I understand that there is still a long way to go,
                    on
                    the programmer's path.
